Change history for aspectj-mode for Emacs, in reverse-chronological order.
===============================================================================
1.0.0 (30 November 2001)

- Support for .aj extension.
- Improved updating of annotations and jumps during editing.
- Pop-up jump menu now placed (with mouse) near cursor.

===============================================================================
1.0rc3 (14 November 2001)

- Fix pop-up jump menu navigation bug.
- Fix XEmacs pop-up menu positioning bug.
- Get pop-up menu navigation to split window like classic buffer-based menu.
- Improved formatting of code elements in jump-menus.

===============================================================================
1.0rc2 (11 October 2001)

Repairs
-------
- Robust handling of new AspectJ declaration kind.
- Compile menu updates properly.
- Initialization performance improved by stopping transitive initialization.
- Missing annotations now displayed.

===============================================================================
1.0rc1 (5 October 2001)

Features
--------
- Default jump-menus are now buffers in aspectj-mode.
- Annotations on non-declarations now supported.

Repairs
-------
- Missing annotations restored.
- Mode documented as aspectj-mode.
- Annotation updates are now done through a combination of an idle timer
  and the after-change-functions hook, thus reducing overhead.
- Fixed unnecessary prompts for changed-file updates.


===============================================================================
1.0b1 (29 August 2001)

Features
--------
- aspectj-mode is now required via (require 'aspectj-mode).
- Annotations and other declarations information are obtained by adding
  the -emacssym flag to ajc, producing a plain-text file with suffix .ajesym.
  Beanshell is no longer required for the operation of aspectj-mode.
- Jump menu is now available as both a buffer and pop-up menu.  The former
  is made available by customizing the Aspectj Classic Jump Menu variable
  (aspectj-classic-jump-menu).
  
Repairs
-------
- Missing declarations warning now shown when declarations missing.

Miscellaneous
-------------
- Documentation is now provided separately for aspectj-mode and AJDEE
  (including this CHANGES file, which has been cloned for the two versions).

===============================================================================
1.0a1 (9 August 2001)

Features
--------
- New toggle in AspectJ menu that removes extensions that are invasive
  to the native modes it extends.  This eases moving between Java and
  AspectJ projects.
- Updates for 1.0 keywords.  Removed keywords no longer deprecated.
- JDEE 2.2.7.1 compatibility.
- JDEE 2.2.8beta4 compatibility.
- speedbar 0.14alpha compatibility.

Miscellaneous
-------------
- The code for extending java-mode and JDEE mode has been split into two
  files to facilitate independent development and maintenance.
- Reformatting of AspectJ menu.
- Removed backwards compatibility for JDE 2.2.6 and earlier.
- Removed sample.makefile, now that .lst file support is more complete.
- Update to version number checks (XEmacs 21.4 on Windows, 21.1.4 on Linux).
- Forces launch of beanshell at earliest possible point.
- Review and update of code documentation.

Repairs
-------
- keymap fix for GNU Emacs 21 alpha.
- Removed easy-mmode implementation for XEmacs (now in pcl-cvs under
  xemacs-packages).
- speedbar-0.14alpha removed buffer-local handling of the
  speedbar-dynamic-tags-function-list, so this is now handled by aspectj-mode.
- Preservation of cursor locations when visiting buffers behind the scenes.
- Fixed jump-menu bug when in --no-windows mode.


===============================================================================
0.8b4 (24 May 2001)

Features
--------
- Support for .lst file compilation via the Compile item on the AspectJ menu
  (both java-mode and JDE).  See Miscellaneous for a related change.
- JDE 2.2.7beta11 compatibility.  (NOTE: AspectJ Mode does not appear to work
  with speedbar 0.14beta1.)

Miscellaneous
-------------
- Changed default value of aspectj-tools-compile-command to "ajc " so that
  the Tools menu's Compile... command will work better for the new .lst file
  compilation features.

===============================================================================
0.8b3 (25 Apr 2001)

Features
--------
- Support for .lst file compilation via the Compile item on the AspectJ menu
  (JDE only, at this time).  aspectj-mode finds all the .lst files in the
  directory of the current file and presents them as options for compilation
  in the Compile menu.  It remembers the list .lst file used for compilation.
- Collapsed the two defcustom variables, aspectj-jde-mode-show-annotations
  and aspectj-java-mode-show-annotations into the single variable
  aspectj-show-annotations.  Please change references to these old variables
  to the new one.
- JDE 2.2.7beta10 compatibility; tested for for XEmacs 21.4.0.

Repairs
-------
- Display of new introductions now properly supported in speedbar and
  annotations.
- AspectJ menu's menu items now disabled when appropriate to do so.
- Tweaks to relative paths in sample.prj.

===============================================================================
0.8b2 (27 Mar 2001)

Features
--------
- JDE 2.2.7beta4 compatibility.

Repairs
-------
- Changed default value of aspectj-jde-no-bovinate customization to nil
  so that JDE completion will work by default.  
- JDE bovination and class list scanning are now turned off when visiting
  buffers to work out the annotations.  It will still do some bovination and
  class scanning, but it will be lessened.
- Menu widths now computed properly for speedbar (JDE).
- Introductions now show properly in annotations and speedbar (although
  private introductions are shown in "target" class, which is in appropriate).
- XEmacs fontification of AspectJ keywords at JDE's new java fontification
  level now works. 
- Right-justification of annotations now computed properly when tabs appear in
  text.
- Editing on an annotated line now updates annotation on the fly to keep its
  proper position (and avoid confusing the cursor position in GNU Emacs).
- Backwards compatibility fix for JDE 2.2.6.

===============================================================================
0.8b1 (15 Mar 2001)

Features
--------
- JDE 2.2.7beta2 compatibility (note that this version of JDE contains bugs),
  still backwards compatible to 2.2.6.
- XEmacs 21.1.13 compatibility (use of fsf-compat packages).  AspectJ mode
  now requires 21.1.13 or higher.  See documentation for using java-mode; JDE
  comes built-in to XEmacs now.
- Classes menu now updates fully automatically.
- ajdoc now supports -version and -author.

Repairs
-------
- aspectj-create-imenu-index now reverts to default-value of
  jde-imenu-create-index-function customization variable when it fails;
  make sure that you are not setting aspectj-create-imenu-index as the
  default value in your .emacs or prj.el files.
- aspectj-version-lessp now correctly extracts the minor-minor number if
  there are more than three terms.
- launch of beanshell under XEmacs now happens on startup and doesn't hang.
- annotations now behave nicely when there are multiple decls on a line.

===============================================================================
0.7b12 (8 Feb 2001)

Repairs
-------
- Jump menu once again works under "no windows" (emac -nw).
- Caching bug fixes (performance) and refactoring.
- aspectj-jde-no-bovinate now turns off jde-which-method-mode.
- put aspectj-reset-annotations-and-jumps-on-command-hook back in
  for backwards compatibility.
- AspectJ Classes menu and speedbar now reverts to JDE's when no
  declarations file and aspectj-jde-no-bovinate is t.
- Improved updating/display of annotations during buffer navigations.

Miscellaneous
-------------
- Extensive remodularization.
- Caching commentary.
- Maintenance commentary.
- User no longer has to set jde-compile-finish-hook (remove settings
  of this from .emacs and prj.el files).  Now set internally via
  local hook settings.

===============================================================================
0.7b11 update (14 Jan 2001)

Repairs
-------
- JDE 2.2.6 compatibility
   + Classes menu built off of defcustom jde-imenu-create-index-functions.
     add this to your customize-variable settings in your .emacs/prj.el:
         '(jde-imenu-create-index-function 'aspectj-create-imenu-index)
     Classes menu still works pre 2.2.6.
   + updated aspectj-jde-no-bovinate functionality.
- fixed erroneous speedbar-frame-width override.
- annoying repetition of "beanshell not found" message removed.
- corrected and expanded keyword highlighting.

===============================================================================
0.7b11 (11 Jan 2001)

Features
--------
- Reorganized documentation, now mostly contained in ajdeForEmacs.html.
- Menu item in AspectJ menu for launching browser to view documentation.
- Mode version number displayed in AspectJ menu.
- Simple version checking for Emacs-en and JDE.
- Small extension to JDE's field/method completion feature to behave better
  with AspectJ (can now find aspect declaration, filters out "hidden" decls).
- JDE Classes menu now shows AspectJ information.
- Javadoc support.  Calls ajdoc with jde-compile-file-specification (if not
  empty), and blocks unsupported -version and -author switches.
- New customization option "aspectj-jde-no-bovinate" (default on), which turns
  off the running of the bovinator.  This saves significant time during loading
  and editing.  The only "negative" effect is that the method designation
  in the modeline (jde-which-method-mode) shows only the current class.
- Jump menu is now provided as a pop-up menu, rather than as a buffer.

Repairs
-------
- Fixed beanshell launch sequence to use JDE's launch when using JDE.
- Fixed XEmacs launch of javaw in java-mode to be java.
- Reduced scope of some overrides of global variables to particular calls.
- XEmacs will no longer hang if the beanshell launch hangs.
- Made post-command-hook buffer local, making annotations update correctly.
  This exposed a bug in JDE (no timer.el), for which I constructed a solution.
- Now truncate annotations on GNU Emacs so that wrapping annotations don't
  screw up cursor positioning.
- Hack to get beanshell to launch in the jde-compile-option-directory.
  Completion works a lot better this way.

Miscellaneous
-------------
- Documentation updated as part of reorganization.
- Added list of known bugs to README.
- Added example Makefile (sample.makefile) and complementary JDE settings
  to sample.prj.

===============================================================================
0.7b10 (14 Dec 2000)

Features
--------
- Full support for XEmacs.  This includes sucking in the code for
  easy-mmode.el and overlay.el so XEmacs users don't have to hunt these down.
- Improved crosscut annotations in code now list types, rather than a count.
- JDE customization examples to invoke ajdb (_emacs.jde-mode, sample.prj)
- Removed hasaspect as a highlighted keyword, added dominates,
  thisStaticJoinPoint, and proceed.

Repairs
-------
- Made aspectj-declarations-timestamp buffer local.
- Fixed references to old packages/files.
- Renamed aspectj-mode menu to AspectJ (with capital J at end)
- Reimplemented menus so that they disappear when the mode is off.
- Fixed right-justification bug in crosscut annotations.

Miscellaneous
-------------
- Updates to README (description of files, update of troubleshooting).
- Default is now "on" for annotations in JDE mode.  Used to be "off".

===============================================================================
0.7b9 (14 Nov 2000)

Features
--------
- Tested on JDE 2.2.5.  Note that JDE 2.2.5 does not work with speedbar .13
  or bovinator 1.3.  See the JDE website for details.

Repairs
-------
- Fixed speedbar feature-interaction bug relating to
  speedbar-tag-hierarchy-method, making sure that
  speedbar-trim-words-tag-hierarchy really isn't called.

===============================================================================
0.7b8 (12 Oct 2000)

No changes were made to AJDE for Emacs in this release.

===============================================================================
0.7b7 (6 Oct 2000)

Features
--------
- Improved caching of declarations/crosscut information, which dramatically
  increases performance with JDE/speedbar.
- Automatic updatng of declarations/crosscut information (due to recompilation)
  for display of annotations and jump menu.
- Now automatically prevents the speedbar menu from getting screwed up by
  speedbar-trim-words-tag-hierarchy.  If you have a custom-set-variables
  entry like this in your .emacs:
  	'(speedbar-tag-hierarchy-method
  	  (quote (speedbar-prefix-group-tag-hierarchy)))
  you can remove it. (Note: this did not actually work; see 0.7b8 repairs)
- Tested on JDE 2.2.4.
  
Repairs
-------
- Fixed declarations mappings.
- Removed reference to undefined variable.
- Fixed unquoted symbol.

Miscellaneous
-------------
- Improved sample .emacs files.
- Example prj.el file (sample.prj) for AspectJ JDE projects.

===============================================================================
0.7b6 (14 Sep 2000)

Features
--------
- New defcustom variables for managing beanshell launch in java-mode.
- New defcustom variable for changing the Compile... command accessed from
  the Emacs Tools menu.
- Tested on JDE 2.2.3 (now requires elib, available from the JDE website).
- Revised/expanded troubleshooting in README
- Simplified .emacs sample files (_emacs.java-mode, _emacs.jde-mode).

Repairs
-------
- Eliminated launch of beanshell when not editing .java files.

Miscellaneous
-------------
- Full separation of extensions for java mode and jde mode.
   + required packages (java-mode extension no longer requires JDE download).
   + documentation (requirements and installation in aspectj-support.el).
   + sample _emacs files (_emacs.java-mode, _emacs.jde-mode).
- Removed call to bsh-prime (now handled in bsh eval loop).

===============================================================================
0.7b5 (21 Aug 2000)

Features
--------
- Upgrade/tested to JDE 2.2.2.

Repairs
-------
- Eliminated modified version of jde.el.  Make sure none lurks in your
  Emacs installation.
- Eliminated dependence of java-mode extensions on jde-run.el.  Extensions
  are still dependent on beanshell.el and bsh.jar in JDE distribution.
- Updated copied version of bsh-internal.el to revision 1.16.

===============================================================================
0.7b4 (9 Aug 2000)

Features
--------
- Upgrade to JDE 2.2.0 and its auxiliary packages, including speedbar (known
  to work on JDE 2.1.8 and higher.)
- Loss of speedbar ``aspectj fall back mode'' when your aspectj files are
  not compiled.

Repairs
-------
- Slightly improved robustness on Unix vis a vis beanshell

Miscellaneous
-------------
- Migrated changes on speedbar.el into aspectj-support.el (make sure

- Improved highlighting for aspectj features

Repairs
-------
- Mode continues to operate even if an .ajysm file from compile is deleted
- Removed ringing bell when going to speedbar fallback mode
- Bug fixes for speedbar fallback mode

Miscellaneous
-------------
- Variable aspectj-font-lock-extra-types is no longer in use.  A set of
  this variable may be lurking in your .emacs/_emacs file as a saved setting.
  Remove it.
- More troubleshooting advice in README

===============================================================================


Features
--------
- Highlighting and indentation support for aspectj features.

- Automatic detection/prevention of bsh start-up race condition (Unix/Linux).

Repairs
-------
- Proper navigation on introduction targets in speedbar.
- Code clean-up.

Miscellaneous
-------------
- Default home subdirectory for release is aspectj0.6, variable load-path
  in .emacs/_emacs file must be updated to load new aspectj-support.el.
- Added section in users-guide.html, and example under spacewar section.
- Changes to README and installation procedure.

===============================================================================
0.5b2 (2 February 2000)

Features
--------
- More information on crosscuts in speedbar display
- Decreased dependence on JDE allows running in Java mode.
  You must now put the line
	(require 'jde)

  while cross-referencing.
- Code clean-up.
- Disabling of annotations feature for XEmacs (which doesn't support overlays).
  XEmacs still doesn't work on ntemacs due to process problem; maybe Unix.

Miscellaneous
-------------
